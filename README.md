# Jamb-Analysis
A Jamb Analysis showing students' performance with insights and recommendations. 

**INSIGHTS**

 The Urban area had more assignments completed than the rural area. Students in Public schools go to school more than those in private schools. Public schools have more study hours per week than private schools. Access to learning materials aids in students' attendance. Distance does not affect attendance rate. Students who attend extra tutorials complete assignments more and also attend school more than students who don't attend extra tutorials.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
1. Learning materials should be made more accessible to students.
2. Extra tutorials could be recommended in schools. This will help struggling students and also boost their confidence.
